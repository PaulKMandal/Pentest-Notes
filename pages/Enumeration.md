- Enumeration is possibly the most critical part of a pentest. The goal is not to gain access to our target computer. Instead, it is identifying all of the ways we could attack a target we must find.
- It's not hard to get access to the target system once we know how to 
  do it. Most of the ways we can get access we can narrow down to the 
  following two points:
	- Functions and/or resources that allow us to interact with the target and/or provide additional information.
	- Information that provides us with even more important information to access our target.
- "Enumeration is the key."
  
  That's what most people say, and they are right. However, it is too often misunderstood. Most people understand that they haven't tried all the tools to get the information they need. Most of the time, however, it's not the tools we haven't tried, but rather the fact that we don't know how to interact with the service and what's relevant.
- That's precisely the reason why so many people stay stuck in one spot and don't get ahead. Had these people invested a couple of hours learning more about the service, how it works, and what it is meant for, they would save a few hours or even days from reaching their goal and get access to the system.
- `Manual enumeration` is a `critical` component. Many scanning tools simplify and accelerate the process. However, these cannot always bypass the security measures of the services due to firewalls and timeouts.
