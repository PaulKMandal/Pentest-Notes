- There are three main types of shells:
	- **Reverse Shell:** Connects back to your system and gives you control through a reverse connection.
	- **Bind Shell:** Waits for you to connect and gives you control once you do.
	- **Web Shell:** Communicates through a web server. Accepts commands through HTTP parameters, executes them, and prints back to the output.
- ## Reverse Shell
	- A reverse shell is the most common type of shell, as it is the quickest and easiest method to gain control over a compromised host. Once we identify a vulnerability on the remote host that allows remote code execution, we can start a netcat listener on our machine that listens on a specific port.
	- With this listener in place, we can execute a reverse shell command that connects the remote systems shell, i.e. Bash or PowerShell, to our netcat listener. This gives us a reverse connection to the system.
	- ```sh
	  ```
	- | Flag | Description |
	  |------|-------------|
	  | `-l` | Listen mode, to wait for a connection to connect to us. |
	  | `-v` | Verbose mode, so that we know when we receive a connection. |
	  | `-n` | Disable DNS resolution and only connect from/to IPs, to speed up the connection. |
	  | `-p 1234` | Port number netcat is listening on, and the reverse connection should be sent to. |
