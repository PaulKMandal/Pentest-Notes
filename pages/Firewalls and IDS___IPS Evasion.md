- We already know that when a port is shown as filtered, it can have several reasons. In most cases, firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections. The packets can either be `dropped`, or `rejected`. The `dropped` packets are ignored, and no response is returned from the host.
- This is different for `rejected` packets that are returned with an `RST` flag. These packets contain different types of ICMP error codes or contain nothing at all.
- ## Ack Scan
	- Nmap's TCP ACK scan (`-sA`) method is much harder to filter for firewalls and IDS/IPS systems than regular SYN (`-sS`) or Connect scans (`sT`) because they only send a TCP packet with only the `ACK` flag. When a port is closed or open, the host must respond with an `RST` flag. Unlike outgoing connections, all connection attempts (with the `SYN` flag) from external networks are usually blocked by firewalls. However, the packets with the `ACK` flag are often passed by the firewall because the firewall cannot determine whether the connection was first established from the external network or the internal network.
	  ```bash
	  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21,22,25 -sA -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace
	  ```
- ## Decoys
	- There are cases in which administrators block specific subnets from different regions in principle. This prevents any access to the target network. Another example is when IPS should block us. For this reason, the Decoy scanning method (`-D`) is the right choice. With this method, Nmap generates various random IP addresses inserted into the IP header to disguise the origin of the packet sent. With this method, we can generate random (`RND`) a specific number (for example: `5`) of IP addresses separated by a colon (`:`). Our real IP address is then randomly placed between the generated IP addresses. In the next example, our real IP address is therefore placed in the second position. Another critical point is that the decoys must be alive. Otherwise, the service on the target may be unreachable due to SYN-flooding security mechanisms.
	  ```bash
	  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -D RND:5
	  ```
	- **10.129.2.28** - Scans the specified target.
	  **-p 80** - Scans only the specified ports.
	  **-sS** - Performs SYN scan on specified ports.
	  **-Pn** - Disables ICMP Echo requests.
	  **-n** - Disables DNS resolution.
	  **--disable-arp-ping** - Disables ARP ping.
	  **--packet-trace** - Shows all packets sent and received.
	  **-D RND:5** - Generates five random IP addresses that indicate the source IP the connection comes from.
	- The spoofed packets are often filtered out by ISPs and routers, even though they come from the same network range. Therefore, we can also specify our VPS servers' IP addresses and use them in combination with "`IP ID`" manipulation in the IP headers to scan the target.
	- Another scenario would be that only individual subnets would not have access to the server's specific services. So we can also manually specify the source IP address (`-S`) to test if we get better results with this one. Decoys can be used for SYN, ACK, ICMP scans, and OS detection scans. So let us look at such an example and determine which operating system it is most likely to be.

	- ## DNS Proxying
	- By default, `Nmap` performs a reverse DNS resolution unless otherwise specified to find more important information about our target. These DNS queries are also passed in most cases because the given web server is supposed to be found and visited. The DNS queries are made over the `UDP port 53`. The `TCP port 53` was previously only used for the so-called "`Zone transfers`" between the DNS servers or data transfer larger than 512 bytes. More and more, this is changing due to IPv6 and DNSSEC expansions. These 
	  changes cause many DNS requests to be made via TCP port 53.
	- However, `Nmap` still gives us a way to specify DNS servers ourselves (`--dns-server <ns>,<ns>`). This method could be fundamental to us if we are in a demilitarized zone (`DMZ`). The company's DNS servers are usually more trusted than those from the Internet. So, for example, we could use them to interact with the hosts of the internal network. As another example, we can use `TCP port 53` as a source port (`--source-port`) for our scans. If the administrator uses the firewall to control this port and does not filter IDS/IPS properly, our TCP packets will be trusted and passed through.
