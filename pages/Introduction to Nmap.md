	- The TCP-SYN scan (`-sS`) is one of the default settings 
	  unless we have defined otherwise and is also one of the most popular 
	  scan methods. This scan method makes it possible to scan several 
	  thousand ports per second.
		- If our target sends an `SYN-ACK` flagged packet back to the scanned port, Nmap detects that the port is `open`.
		- If the packet receives an `RST` flag, it is an indicator that the port is `closed`.
		- If Nmap does not receive a packet back, it will display it as `filtered`. Depending on the firewall configuration, certain packets may be dropped or ignored by the firewall.
