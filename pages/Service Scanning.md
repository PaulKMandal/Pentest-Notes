## #Nmap
	- Nmap, by default, will perform a TCP scan of only the 1000 most common ports of an IP by default
	- ### Simple Usage
		- ```sh
		  nmap 10.129.42.253
		  ```
		- Output:
		- ```code
		  Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-25 16:07 EST
		  Nmap scan report for 10.129.42.253
		  Host is up (0.11s latency).
		  Not shown: 995 closed ports
		  PORT    STATE SERVICE
		  21/tcp  open  ftp
		  22/tcp  open  ssh
		  80/tcp  open  http
		  139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
		  445/tcp open  microsoft-ds
		  ```
		- The `STATE` will list whether the port is open or filtered. Filtered generally means that there is a firewall in place.
		- The `SERVICE` will list the service name. By default, this is just mapped using the common port number unless we give the `-sV` flag.
	- ### More Complex Usage
		- We can supply the `-sC` flag to obtain more detailed information, the -sV flag to perform a version scan, and -p- to tell nmap to scan all 65,535 TCP ports
		- ```sh
		  nmap -sV -sC -p- 10.129.42.253
		  ```
		- I won't paste the full output, but this will get the service versions.
	- ### Supplying Scripts
		- A user can supply a script to #Nmap. Suppose if a user wanted to audit a large Citrix installation. A user could locate the citrix scripts via the use of
			- ```sh
			  locate scripts/citrix
			  ```
		- They could then run a script with the syntax
			- ```sh
			  nmap --script <script name> -p<port> <host>
			  ```
	- ### Banner Grabbing
		- Recall that a #bannergrab may be preformed by using #Netcat using the syntax
			- ```sh
			  nc -nv 10.129.42.253 21
			  ```
		- This may be automated across an entire subnet using nmap via the syntax
			- ```sh
			  nmap -sV --script=banner -p21 10.10.10.0/24
			  ```
- ## Attacking Network Services
	- ## #FTP
		- Let's briefly talk about scanning and connecting to an FTP service. We can scan for ftp (assuming it is running on port 21) by using the #Nmap command:
			- ```sh
			  nmap -sC -sV -p21 10.129.42.253
			  ```
			- ```code
			  Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-20 00:54 GMT
			  Nmap scan report for 10.129.42.253
			  Host is up (0.081s latency).

		- Line 6 indicates that the version is vsftpd 3.0.3. Line 8 indicates that there is a pub directory available.
		- Let's connect to the ftp service:
			- ```sh
			  ftp -p 10.129.42.253
			  ```
			- ```code

			  ```
		- FTP supports cd and ls. It also allows us to download commands with get. We can cat out the downloaded login.txt to get the credentials.
			- ```sh
			  cat login.txt 
			  ```
			- ```code
			  admin:ftp@dmin123
			  ```
	- ## #SMB
		- The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network. It is a common attack vector for #Windows machines.
		- Sensitive data, including credentials, can be in network file shares, 
		  and some SMB versions may be vulnerable to RCE exploits such as [EternalBlue](https://www.avast.com/c-eternalblue). It is crucial to enumerate this sizeable potential attack surface carefully.
		- `Nmap` has many scripts for enumerating SMB, such as [smb-os-discovery.nse](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html), which will interact with the SMB service to extract the reported operating system version.
		- ```sh
		  nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p445 10.10.10.40
		  ```
		- ```code
		  Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-27 00:59 GMT
		  Nmap scan report for doctors.htb (10.10.10.40)
		  Host is up (0.022s latency).

		  Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.71 seconds
		  ```
		- Here, we can confirm that the host in fact runs Windows 7 and could conduct further enumeration to confirm if the host is vulnerable to EternalBlue. The #Metasploit Framework has several vulnerabilities to validate and exploit this vulnerability.
		- We can run a scan against the target module to gather information for the SMB service.
		- ```sh
		  nmap -A -p445 10.129.42.253
		  ```
		- ```code

		  ```
		- Here, the host runs a linux kernel, Samba version 4.6.2, and the hostname is GS-SVCSCAN
		- ## #SMB/Shares and #smbclient
			- SMB allows users and administrators to share folders and make them remotely accessible to other users. Often, these shares have files that contain sensitive information such as passwords.
			- We can use smbclient to interact with smb shares. The `-L` flag specifies we want to list available shares on the host. `-N` suppresses the password prompt.
			- ```sh
			  smbclient -N -L \\\\10.129.42.253
			  ```
			- ```code
			  	Sharename       Type      Comment
			  	---------       ----      -------
			  	print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
			  	users           Disk      
			  	IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (gs-svcscan server (Samba, Ubuntu))
			  SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
			  ```
			- This reveals a non-default share, `users`. Let us connect.
			- ```sh
			  smbclient \\\\10.129.42.253\\users
			  ```
			- ```code
			  Enter WORKGROUP\users's password: 
			  Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
			  
			  smb: \> ls
			  NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED listing \*
			  
			  smb: \> exit
			  ```
			- The ls command resulted in an access denied message. Let's try again using the credentials for user bob (bob:Welcome1).
			- ```sh
			  smbclient -U bob \\\\10.129.42.253\\users
			  ```
			- ```code
			  Enter WORKGROUP\bob's password: 
			  Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
			  
			  smb: \> ls

			  smb: \bob\> get passwords.txt 
			  getting file \bob\passwords.txt of size 156 as passwords.txt (0.3 KiloBytes/sec) (average 0.3 KiloBytes/sec)

			- This allows us to acces passwords.txt which we can download with the get command.
	- ## [[SNMP]]
		- SNMP community strings provide information and statistics about a router device. The manufacturer default community strings of public and private are often unchanged. SNMP 1 and 2c are unencrypted. Encryption was only added in SNMP 3.
		- ```sh
		  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 10.129.42.253 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0
		  ```
		- ```code
		  iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: "gs-svcscan"
		  ```
		- ```sh
		  snmpwalk -v 2c -c private  10.129.42.253 
		  ```
		- ```code
		  Timeout: No Response from 10.129.42.253
		  ```
		- We can brute force the community string names using a dictionary file of common community strings.
		- ```sh
		  onesixtyone -c dict.txt 10.129.42.254
		  ```
		- ```code
		  Scanning 1 hosts, 51 communities
		  10.129.42.254 [public] Linux gs-svcscan 5.4.0-66-generic #74-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jan 27 22:54:38 UTC 2021 x86_64
