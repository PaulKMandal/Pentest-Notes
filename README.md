# Pentest-Notes
These are my notes on pentesting, primarily taken from the Hack The Box Penetration Tester specialization: https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/penetration-tester

I use LogSeq to write these notes, so either LogSeq or Obsidian should work. Otherwise they will just look like a garbled mess.
