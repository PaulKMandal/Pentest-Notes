- Scanning performance plays a significant role when we need to scan an
  extensive network or are dealing with low network bandwidth. We can use
  various options to tell `Nmap` how fast (`-T <0-5>`), with which frequency (`--min-parallelism <number>`), which timeouts (`--max-rtt-timeout <time>`) the test packets should have, how many packets should be sent simultaneously (`--min-rate <number>`), and with the number of retries (`--max-retries <number>`) for the scanned ports the targets should be scanned.
- ## Timeouts
	- When Nmap sends a packet, it takes some time (`Round-Trip-Time` - `RTT`) to receive a response from the scanned port. Generally, `Nmap` starts with a high timeout (`--min-RTT-timeout`) of 100ms. Let us look at an example by scanning the whole network with 256 hosts, including the top 100 ports.
	- ```bash
	  sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms --max-rtt-timeout 100ms
	  ```
	- `initial-rtt-timeout 50ms` - Sets the specified time value as initial RTT timeout.
	- `--max-rtt-timeout 100ms` - Sets the specified time value as maximum RTT timeout.
	- `-F` - Scans the top 100 ports
- ## Max Retries
	- ```bash
	  sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --max-retries 0 
	  ```
	- This can reduce accuracy
- ## Rates
	- During a white-box penetration test, we may get whitelisted for the security systems to check the systems in the network for vulnerabilities and not only test the protection measures. If we know the network bandwidth, we can work with the rate of packets sent, which significantly speeds up our scans with Nmap. When setting the minimum rate (--min-rate <number>) for sending packets, we tell Nmap to simultaneously send the specified number of packets. It will attempt to maintain the rate accordingly.
	- ```bash
	  sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.minrate300 --min-rate 300
	  ```
	- -oN tnet.minrate300 - Saves in default format
	- --min0rate 300 - sets minimum number of packets per second.
- ## Timing
	- `-T 0` / `-T paranoid`
	- `-T 1` / `-T sneaky`
	- `-T 2` / `-T polite`
	- `-T 3` / `-T normal`
	- `-T 4` / `-T aggressive`
	- `-T 5` / `-T insane`
