## Nmap Port States
	- **Open** - This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be **TCP connections**, **UDP datagrams** as well as **SCTP associations**.
	- **Closed** - When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an `RST` flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not.
	- **Filtered** - Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.
	- **Unfiltered** - This state of a port only occurs during the **TCP-ACK** scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.
	- **Open | filtered** - If we do not get a response for a specific port, `Nmap` will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.
	- **Closed | filtered** - This state only occurs in the **IP ID idle** scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.
- ## Discovering Open TCP Ports
	- By default, `Nmap` scans the top 1000 TCP ports with the SYN scan (`-sS`).
	   This SYN scan is set only to default when we run it as root because of 
	  the socket permissions required to create raw TCP packets. Otherwise, 
	  the TCP scan (`-sT`) is performed by default.
	- We can define the ports one by one (`-p 22,25,80,139,445`), by range (`-p 22-445`), by top ports (`--top-ports=10`) from the `Nmap` database that have been signed as most frequent, by scanning all ports (`-p-`) but also by defining a fast port scan, which contains top 100 ports (`-F`).
	- ```bash
	  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 --top-ports=10 
	  ```
	- We see that we only scanned the top 10 TCP ports of our target, and `Nmap` displays their state accordingly. If we trace the packets `Nmap` sends, we will see the `RST` flag on `TCP port 21` that our target sends back to us. To have a clear view of the SYN scan, we disable the ICMP echo requests (`-Pn`), DNS resolution (`-n`), and ARP ping scan (`--disable-arp-ping`).
	- ```bash
	  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21 --packet-trace -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping
	  ```
	  ```output

	  ```
	- We can see from the SENT line that we (`10.10.14.2`) sent a TCP packet with the `SYN` flag (`S`) to our target (`10.129.2.28`). In the next RCVD line, we can see that the target responds with a TCP packet containing the `RST` and `ACK` flags (`RA`). `RST` and `ACK` flags are used to acknowledge receipt of the TCP packet (`ACK`) and to end the TCP session (`RST`).
- ## Connect Scan
	- The Nmap [TCP Connect Scan](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-connect-scan.html) (`-sT`) uses the TCP three-way handshake to determine if a specific port on a target host is open or closed. The scan sends an `SYN` packet to the target port and waits for a response. It is considered open if the target port responds with an `SYN-ACK` packet and closed if it responds with an `RST` packet. The `Connect` scan is useful because it is the most accurate way to determine the state of a port, and it is also the most stealthy.
	  ```bash
	  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 443 --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping -Pn -n --reason -sT 
	  ```
	  ```output

	  ```
- ## Filtered Ports
	- When a port is shown as filtered, it can have several reasons. In most cases, firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections. The packets can either be `dropped`, or `rejected`. When a packet gets dropped, `Nmap` receives no response from our target, and by default, the retry rate (`--max-retries`) is set to 1. This means `Nmap` will resend the request to the target port to determine if the previous packet was not accidentally mishandled.
	- Let us look at an example where the firewall `drops` the TCP packets we send for the port scan. Therefore we scan the TCP port **139**, which was already shown as filtered. To be able to track how our sent packets are handled, we deactivate the ICMP echo requests (`-Pn`), DNS resolution (`-n`), and ARP ping scan (`--disable-arp-ping`) again.
	  ```bash
	  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 139 --packet-trace -n --disable-arp-ping -Pn
	  ```
	  ```output
	  Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 15:45 CEST

	  ```
	- We see in the last scan that `Nmap` sent two TCP packets with the SYN flag. By the duration (`2.06s`) of the scan, we can recognize that it took much longer than the previous ones (`~0.05s`). The case is different if the firewall rejects the packets. For this, we look at TCP port `445`, which is handled accordingly by such a rule of the firewall.
	  ```bash
	  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 445 --packet-trace -n --disable-arp-ping -Pn
	  ```

	  ```
	- As a response, we receive an `ICMP` reply with `type 3` and `error code 3`,
	   which indicates that the desired port is unreachable. Nevertheless, if we know that the host is alive, we can strongly assume that the firewall on this port is rejecting the packets, and we will have to take a closer look at this port later.
- ## Discovering Open UDP Ports
	- Some system administrators sometimes forget to filter the UDP ports in addition to the TCP ones. Since `UDP` is a `stateless protocol` and does not require a three-way handshake like TCP. We do not receive any acknowledgment. Consequently, the timeout is much longer, making the whole `UDP scan` (`-sU`) much slower than the `TCP scan` (`-sS`).
	  ```bash
	  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -F -sU
	  ```
	  ```output
	  Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 16:01 CEST
	  Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.28
	  Host is up (0.059s latency).
	  Not shown: 95 closed ports

	  68/udp   open|filtered dhcpc
	  137/udp  open          netbios-ns

	  MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF (Intel Corporate)
	  
	  Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 98.07 seconds
	  ```
	- Another disadvantage of this is that we often do not get a response back because `Nmap` sends empty datagrams to the scanned UDP ports, and we do not receive any response. So we cannot determine if the UDP packet has arrived at all or not. If the UDP port is `open`, we only get a response if the application is configured to do so.
	  ```bash
	  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -sU -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 137 --reason

	- Another handy method for scanning ports is the `-sV` option 
	  which is used to get additional available information from the open 
	  ports. This method can identify versions, service names, and details 
	  about our target.

- ## Grabbing Info with TCP Dump and Netcat
	- We can grab info by using tcpdump to log information and using netcat to establish connections:
	  ```bash
	  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 10.10.14.2 and 10.129.2.28
	  ```
	  ```output
	  tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
	  listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
